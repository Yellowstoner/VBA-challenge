Analyzing stock market data

Using Visual Basic, I have created a script that loops through yearly stock information and outputs the following:
  Ticker Symbol
  Yearly Change
  % Change
  Total Stock Volume
  
The solution also includes the "Greatest % Increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest Total Volume".

You will find screenshots, excel files, and a VBA script contained in this repository.
